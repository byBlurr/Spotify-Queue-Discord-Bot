### Spotify-Queue-Discord-Bot
Just a little bot to queue songs from Discord. Used when using the Spotify party thing in a server instead of a bot in the voice channel.

#### Use
1. Download the latest version
2. Extract the zip
3. Run `SpotifyQueueBot.exe`
4. Enter your bot token from Discord.com/Developers (You need to create a bot, thats beyond the scope of this...)
5. A window will open to sign into Spotify, login and authorize
6. Play a Spotify song manually and then Invite a channel to listen
7. Add/skip/view queues using commands

#### Commands
- `++ <songname>` Queue a song
- `+=` View the queue
- `+-` Skip the current song

#### Notes
- For now it is using my client id and client secret for Spotify's API... This will change so that you also have to provide this.
